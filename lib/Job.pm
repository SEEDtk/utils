=head1 Web Job Management

This object manages an Alexa background job. Each job is assigned a UUID, and its status is stored in
a file with the name C<Job.>I<UUID>C<.status>. The status file contains the following items, tab-separated.

=over 4

=item *

A task name, assigned by the object client.

=item *

The UUID of the job.

=item *

The process ID of the job.

=item *

The job status-- C<running>, C<completed>, C<failed>, or C<informed>.

=item *

A status message from the job.

=back

The job must create this object when it starts and call the L</Fail> method when it fails or the L</Finish> method when it
terminates normally. It can call the L</Progress> method to record progress. It cannot use STDOUT, STDERR, or STDIN.
Web tasks can use the static L</Check> method to check the status of jobs in progress, Any with the C<completed> or C<failed>
status will be reported, and the status changed to C<informed>.

The static L</Purge> method can be used to remove all jobs with status C<informed>. This should be done periodically to avoid
performance problems with L</Check>.

The static L</Create> method is used to create the job.

Each job is assigned a private directory under the session directory with the
same name as the job's UUID. The L</workDir> method of this object returns the job's working directory and the
L</opt> method returns the L<Getopt::Long::Descriptive::Opts> method for accessing the command-line options.

This object contains the following fields.

=over 4

=item workDir

The name of the working directory for the job.

=item statusFile

The name of the job's status file.

=item UUID

The job's ID.

=item pid

The job's process ID.

=item taskName

The job's task name.

=item opt

The L<Getopt::Long::Descriptive::Opts> object for the command-line options.

=item status

The current status of the job (C<running>, C<failed>, C<completed>, or C<informed>).

=item comment

The last comment about the job's progress and/or status.

=back

=head2 Static Methods for Web Interface

=head3 Create

    my $pid = Job::Create($sessionDir, $name, $command, @parms);

=over 4

=item sessionDir

=item name

=item command

The command to execute (without the C<.pl> suffix). It must be a script in the SEEDtk script libraries.

=item parms

A list of the job's parameters.

=item RETURN

Returns the process ID of the job created (on Windows) or 0 (on Unix/Mac).
