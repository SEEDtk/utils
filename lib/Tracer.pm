=head3 ParseDate

    my $time = Tracer::ParseDate($dateString);

Convert a date into a PERL time number. This method expects a date-like string
and parses it into a number. The string must be vaguely date-like or it will
return an undefined value. Our requirement is that a month and day be
present and that three pieces of the date string (time of day, month and day,
year) be separated by likely delimiters, such as spaces, commas, and such-like.

If a time of day is present, it must be in military time with two digits for
everything but the hour.

The year must be exactly four digits.

Additional stuff can be in the string. We presume it's time zones or weekdays or something
equally innocuous. This means, however, that a sufficiently long sentence with date-like
parts in it may be interpreted as a date. Hopefully this will not be a problem.

It should be guaranteed that this method will parse the output of the L</Now> function.

The parameters are as follows.

=over 4

=item dateString

The date string to convert.

=item RETURN

Returns a PERL time, that is, a number of seconds since the epoch, or C<undef> if
the date string is invalid. A valid date string must contain a month and day.

    }
    # Return the merged list.
    return @inputList;
}

=head3 Open

    my $handle = Open($fileHandle, $fileSpec, $message);

Open a file.

The I<$fileSpec> is essentially the second argument of the PERL C<open>
function. The mode is specified using Unix-like shell information. So, for
example,

    Open(\*LOGFILE, '>>/usr/spool/news/twitlog', "Could not open twit log.");

would open for output appended to the specified file, and

    Open(\*DATASTREAM, "| sort -u >$outputFile", "Could not open $outputFile.");

would open a pipe that sorts the records written and removes duplicates. Note
the use of file handle syntax in the Open call. To use anonymous file handles,
code as follows.

    my $logFile = Open(undef, '>>/usr/spool/news/twitlog', "Could not open twit log.");

The I<$message> parameter is used if the open fails. If it is set to C<0>, then
the open returns TRUE if successful and FALSE if an error occurred. Otherwise, a
failed open will throw an exception and the third parameter will be used to construct
an error message. If the parameter is omitted, a standard message is constructed
using the file spec.

    Could not open "/usr/spool/news/twitlog"

Note that the mode characters are automatically cleaned from the file name.
The actual error message from the file system will be captured and appended to the
message in any case.

    Could not open "/usr/spool/news/twitlog": file not found.

In some versions of PERL the only error message we get is a number, which
corresponds to the C++ C<errno> value.

    Could not open "/usr/spool/news/twitlog": 6.

=over 4

=item fileHandle

File handle. If this parameter is C<undef>, a file handle will be generated
and returned as the value of this method.

=item fileSpec

File name and mode, as per the PERL C<open> function.

=item message (optional)

Error message to use if the open fails. If omitted, a standard error message
will be generated. In either case, the error information from the file system
is appended to the message. To specify a conditional open that does not throw
an error if it fails, use C<0>.

=item RETURN

Returns the name of the file handle assigned to the file, or C<undef> if the
open failed.

=back

=cut

sub Open {
    # Get the parameters.
    my ($fileHandle, $fileSpec, $message) = @_;
    # Attempt to open the file.
    my $rv = open $fileHandle, $fileSpec;
    # If the open failed, generate an error message.
    if (! $rv) {
        # Save the system error message.
        my $sysMessage = $!;
        # See if we need a default message.
        if (!$message) {
            # Clean any obvious mode characters and leading spaces from the
            # filename.

            $message = "Could not open \"$fileName\"";
        }
        # Terminate with an error using the supplied message and the
        # error message from the file system.
        Confess("$message: $!");
    }
    # Return the file handle.
    return $fileHandle;
}

=head3 FindNamePart

    my ($fileName, $start, $len) = Tracer::FindNamePart($fileSpec);

Extract the portion of a file specification that contains the file name.

A file specification is the string passed to an C<open> call. It specifies the file
mode and name. In a truly complex situation, it can specify a pipe sequence. This
method assumes that the file name is whatever follows the first angle bracket
sequence.  So, for example, in the following strings the file name is
C</usr/fig/myfile.txt>.

    >>/usr/fig/myfile.txt
    </usr/fig/myfile.txt
    | sort -u > /usr/fig/myfile.txt

If the method cannot find a file name using its normal methods, it will return the
whole incoming string.

=over 4

=item fileSpec

File specification string from which the file name is to be extracted.

=item RETURN

Returns a three-element list. The first element contains the file name portion of
the specified string, or the whole string if a file name cannot be found via normal
methods. The second element contains the start position of the file name portion and
the third element contains the length.

=back

    # Get the parameters.
    my ($fileSpec) = @_;

    # Parse out the file name if we can.

        $retVal = $2;
        $len = length $retVal;
        $pos = (length $fileSpec) - (length $3) - $len;
    }
    # Return the result.
    return ($retVal, $pos, $len);
}

=head3 OpenDir

    my @files = OpenDir($dirName, $filtered, $flag);

Open a directory and return all the file names. This function essentially performs
the functions of an C<opendir> and C<readdir>. If the I<$filtered> parameter is
set to TRUE, all filenames beginning with a period (C<.>), dollar sign (C<$>),
or pound sign (C<#>) and all filenames ending with a tilde C<~>) will be
filtered out of the return list. If the directory does not open and I<$flag> is not
set, an exception is thrown. So, for example,

    my @files = OpenDir("/Volumes/fig/contigs", 1);

is effectively the same as

    opendir(TMP, "/Volumes/fig/contigs") || Confess("Could not open /Volumes/fig/contigs.");
    my @files = grep { $_ !~ /^[\.\$\#]/ && $_ !~ /~$/ } readdir(TMP);

Similarly, the following code

    my @files = grep { $_ =~ /^\d/ } OpenDir("/Volumes/fig/orgs", 0, 1);

Returns the names of all files in C</Volumes/fig/orgs> that begin with digits and
automatically returns an empty list if the directory fails to open.

=over 4

=item dirName

Name of the directory to open.

=item filtered

TRUE if files whose names begin with a period (C<.>) should be automatically removed
from the list, else FALSE.

This method performs a universal sort comparison. Each value coming in is
separated into a text parts and number parts. The text
part is string compared, and if both parts are equal, then the number
parts are compared numerically. A stream of just numbers or a stream of

numbers first. Strings with a label and a number will sort in the
expected manner instead of lexically. Undefined values sort last.

=head3 ListEQ

    my $flag = Tracer::ListEQ(\@a, \@b);

Return TRUE if the specified lists contain the same strings in the same
order, else FALSE.

=over 4

=item a

Reference to the first list.

=item b

Reference to the second list.

=item RETURN

Returns TRUE if the two parameters are identical string lists, else FALSE.

=head3 Clean

Clean up a string for HTML display. This not only converts special
characters to HTML entity names, it also removes control characters.

=item string

String to convert.

=item RETURN

Returns the input string with anything that might disrupt an HTML literal removed. An
undefined value will be converted to an empty string.

=head3 SortByValue

    my @keys = Tracer::SortByValue(\%hash);

Get a list of hash table keys sorted by hash table values.

=over 4

=item hash

Hash reference whose keys are to be extracted.

=item RETURN

Returns a list of the hash keys, ordered so that the corresponding hash values
are in alphabetical sequence.

=head3 GetSet

Get or set the value of an object field. The object is treated as an
ordinary hash reference. If a new value is specified, it is stored in the
hash under the specified name and then returned. If no new value is
specified, the current value is returned.

=over 4

=item object

Reference to the hash that is to be interrogated or updated.

=item name

Name of the field. This is the hash key.

=item newValue (optional)

New value to be stored in the field. If no new value is specified, the current
value of the field is returned.

=item RETURN

Returns the value of the named field in the specified hash.
